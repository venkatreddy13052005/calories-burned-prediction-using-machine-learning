This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activities based on individual attributes and exercise parameters.

Features
Utilizes a dataset containing attributes like age, gender, weight, height, duration, and heart rate.
Implements data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Employs machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest for accurate calorie predictions.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be used in the fitness domain to estimate energy expenditure, helping users plan and track their physical activities efficiently.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn libraries
